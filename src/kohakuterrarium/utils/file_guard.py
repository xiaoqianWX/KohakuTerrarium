"""
File safety guards for tool operations.

Provides three independent guards used by file-manipulating tools:

1. **Read state tracking**: Records which files the model has read,
   enforces read-before-write/edit, detects staleness via mtime.
2. **Path boundary check**: Warns or blocks access to files outside
   the agent's working directory. First attempt to a new outside
   path is blocked with a warning; retrying the same path is allowed.
3. **Binary file detection**: Prevents reading/editing binary files
   that would produce garbled output.
