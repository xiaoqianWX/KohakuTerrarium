# scratchpad

Read/write session-scoped working memory. Data persists within the current
session but is cleared on restart. Unlike file-based memory, scratchpad is
framework-managed, structured (key-value), and cheap (no LLM cost to read/write).

## WHEN TO USE

- Storing a multi-step plan before executing it
- Tracking progress through a complex task (completed steps, remaining work)
- Saving notes or intermediate results during multi-step reasoning
- Keeping a todo list or checklist across multiple turns
- Remembering decisions or constraints discovered mid-task
- Accumulating findings from searches before synthesizing

## HOW TO USE

```
[/scratchpad]
@@action=set
@@key=key_name
value content here
[scratchpad/]
```

Supported actions: `get`, `set`, `delete`, `list`, `clear`.

## Arguments

| Arg | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| action | @@arg | Action to perform: get, set, delete, list, or clear |
| key | @@arg | Key name (required for get, set, delete) |
| value | content | Value to store (required for set; everything after the args) |

## Examples

Store a plan:
```
[/scratchpad]
@@action=set
@@key=plan
1. Read the config file
2. Identify the broken handler
3. Fix the handler
4. Run tests
[scratchpad/]
```

Retrieve a value:
```
[/scratchpad]
@@action=get
@@key=plan
[scratchpad/]
```

List all stored keys:
```
[/scratchpad]
@@action=list
[scratchpad/]
```

Delete a key:
```
[/scratchpad]
@@action=delete
@@key=plan
[scratchpad/]
```

Clear all data:
```
[/scratchpad]
@@action=clear
[scratchpad/]
```

## Output Format

- **get**: Returns the stored value, or "Key 'x' not found" if missing
- **set**: Returns "Set 'key_name'" as confirmation
- **delete**: Returns "Deleted 'key_name'" or "Key 'x' not found"
- **list**: Returns a bullet list of all keys, or "(empty)"
- **clear**: Returns "Scratchpad cleared"

## LIMITATIONS

- Session-scoped only (data is lost on restart)
- Keys are flat strings (no nested namespaces)
- Values are stored as plain text (no binary data)

## TIPS

- Use descriptive key names: `plan`, `progress`, `findings`, `constraints`
- Multi-line values work well for plans and checklists
- Use `list` to review what you have stored before deciding next steps
- Scratchpad contents are auto-injected into context as "Working Memory"
- Prefer scratchpad over repeating information in your messages
- Use `clear` when starting a fresh subtask to avoid stale data
