## Arguments

| Arg | Type | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| path | attribute | Path to file (required) |
| diff | body | Unified diff content |

## Diff Format

```
@@ -start,count +start,count @@
-line to remove
+line to add
 context line (unchanged)
```

- Lines starting with `-` are removed
- Lines starting with `+` are added
- Lines starting with ` ` (space) are context

## Examples

Replace a function:
```xml
<edit path="src/main.py">
@@ -5,3 +5,3 @@
-def hello():
-    print("Hi")
+def hello():
+    print("Hello, World!")
</edit>
```

Add import:
```xml
<edit path="src/utils.py">
@@ -1,1 +1,2 @@
 import os
+import sys
</edit>
```

Delete lines:
```xml
<edit path="src/old.py">
@@ -10,3 +10,1 @@
 # Keep this comment
-# Delete this
-# And this
</edit>
```

## Tips

- Use `<read path="file"/>` first to see line numbers
- Include context lines to anchor changes
- Line numbers in @@ are 1-indexed
- Multiple hunks can be in one diff
