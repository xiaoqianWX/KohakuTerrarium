"""Terrarium-side resolver for the output-wiring framework feature.

The core layer defines the protocol and a no-op default. This module
provides the real resolver that knows how to look up targets by name
inside a running terrarium and push ``creature_output`` events straight
into their event queues.

Resolution rules:

- ``entry.to == "root"`` (magic string, see ``core.output_wiring.ROOT_TARGET``)
  resolves to the terrarium's root agent. Unknown when no root is
  configured → logged and skipped.
- Any other value is looked up as a creature name in the terrarium.
  Unknown / stopped creatures are logged and skipped.

Delivery is fire-and-forget: each target receives its event via
``asyncio.create_task(target_agent._process_event(event))`` so the
source creature's ``_finalize_processing`` never blocks on a downstream
LLM round. Plugins installed on the receiver see the event through the
existing ``on_event`` notify in ``Agent._process_event``.
