# Tool

## What it is

A **tool** is how an agent *does* something. It is an executable
capability, registered with the controller, that the LLM can call by
name with arguments.

In most people's mental model a tool is "a function the LLM can call":
`bash`, `read`, `write`, `grep`, `web_search`. That is accurate but
incomplete. A tool can also be a message bus to another agent, a
state-machine handle, a nested creature, a permission gate, or all of
those at once.

## Why it exists

A chat bot is just a mouth. Tools give the agent hands. Without them
the LLM can only speak — with them it can do arbitrary work in the
world.

The framework's job is to make tool execution *cheap to use and cheap
to write*: streaming-aware dispatch, parallel execution, context
propagation, background jobs, and typed metadata. Every existing agent
product re-implements some subset of that; putting it in the substrate
once stops that cycle.

## How we define it

A tool implements:

- a **name** and a short description (auto-inserted into the system prompt)
- an **args schema** (`parameters`), JSON-Schema-compatible
- an async **`execute(args, context)` → `ToolResult`**
- an **execution mode**: `direct` (default), `background`, or `stateful`
- optional **full documentation** (`get_full_documentation()`) loaded
  on demand via the `info` framework command

Execution modes:

- **Direct** — await the tool within the same turn; feed the result
  back as a `tool_complete` event.
- **Background** — submit and release; result arrives in a later event.
- **Stateful** — multi-turn interaction; a generator-like tool that
  yields intermediate results the agent can react to.

## How we implement it

Tools are registered in the `Registry` (`core/registry.py`). The
controller's stream parser detects tool blocks as they close and calls
`Executor.submit_from_event(...)` immediately. The executor creates an
`asyncio.Task`; multiple tools run in parallel.

Each tool execution receives a `ToolContext` carrying:

- the creature's working directory,
- the session (scratchpad, private channels),
- the environment (shared channels, if any),
- file guards (read-before-write, path safety),
- file-read-state (for dedup),
- the agent name,
- the job store (so the `wait` / `read_job` framework commands can find the tool's job).

Built-in tools include shell (`bash`), Python (`python`), file ops
(`read`, `write`, `edit`, `multi_edit`), search (`glob`, `grep`,
`tree`), JSON (`json_read`, `json_write`), web (`web_fetch`,
`web_search`), communication (`send_message`), memory (`scratchpad`,
`search_memory`), introspection (`info`, `stop_task`),
and terrarium management (`terrarium_create`, `creature_start`, …).

## What you can therefore do

- **Tools as message busses.** `send_message` writes to a channel; a
  `ChannelTrigger` on another creature reads it. Two tools + one
  trigger reproduce a group-chat pattern with zero new primitives.
- **Tools as state handles.** The `scratchpad` tool is a classic KV
  API; any cooperating tools can rendezvous through it.
- **Tools that install triggers.** Any universal trigger class
  (`TimerTrigger`, `ChannelTrigger`, `SchedulerTrigger` by default) can
  be exposed as a tool of its own — listing it under `tools:` with
  `type: trigger` makes `add_timer` / `watch_channel` / `add_schedule`
  show up in the tool list, and calling one installs that trigger on
  the live `TriggerManager`. `terrarium_create` starts an entire
  nested system.
- **Tools that wrap sub-agents.** Any sub-agent invocation is itself
  tool-shaped, because the LLM calls it by name with args.
- **Tools that run agents.** Because tools are plain Python, a tool can
  contain an agent — e.g. a guard tool that runs a small judging agent
  on the arguments before dispatching the real action. See
  [patterns](../patterns.md).

## Don't be bounded

Tools do not have to be "pure." They can mutate state, start
long-running work, coordinate with other creatures, or orchestrate
entire terrariums. They also do not have to be obvious: a tool whose
only effect is to mark a session as "ready for compaction" is
legitimate. The abstraction is "a thing the LLM can call"; the
framework does not police what happens behind the call.
