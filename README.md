## Where KohakuTerrarium Fits

AI tools exist at different **application layers** and serve different **roles**. This 2D view reveals a gap:

|  | Product | Framework | Utility / Wrapper |
|--|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| **LLM App** | ChatGPT, Claude.ai | LangChain, LangGraph, Dify | DSPy |
| **Agent** | Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode | smolagents (thin), **KohakuTerrarium** | — |
| **Multi-Agent** | — | **KohakuTerrarium** | CrewAI, AutoGen |

- **LLM app frameworks** (LangChain, Dify) orchestrate LLM calls and chains. You build agents FROM them, but they don't define what an agent IS.
- **Agent products** (Claude Code, Codex) are real, sophisticated agents — but closed. You can't decompose, reconfigure, or compose them.
- **smolagents** is genuinely agent-level, but too thin — one loop, one tool list, no module system, no composition.
- **CrewAI / AutoGen** call themselves agent frameworks, but their "agent" is a thin LLM wrapper with a role string. They operate at the multi-agent layer without properly defining the agent underneath.

The gap: **a comprehensive framework at the agent level** — one that defines what an agent actually is as a first-class abstraction, with enough depth to model real agent products, not just toy demos.

## What KohakuTerrarium Is

KohakuTerrarium is a **universal agent-level abstraction framework**. It defines what an agent is (a **creature**), provides five composable module types to build any kind of agent, and includes a wiring layer (a **terrarium**) for horizontal multi-agent composition.

The core claim: **the creature abstraction is comprehensive enough to model virtually any existing agent product**.

A creature is a complete agent abstraction composed of:

- **Controller** — the LLM reasoning loop (any model, any provider, any tool-call format)
- **Input** — how events enter the agent (CLI, TUI, voice/ASR, webhooks, Discord, API — swappable)
- **Output** — how the agent delivers results (stdout, TTS, Discord, file, API — swappable)
- **Tools** — what the agent can do (file ops, shell, web, APIs, databases — pluggable)
- **Triggers** — what wakes the agent up (user input, timers, channel messages, schedules — composable)
- **Sub-agents** — internal delegation (explore, plan, implement, review — nested, parallel)

Every module is **independently customizable**. Swap any piece without touching the rest. A **plugin system** intercepts how modules communicate — inject RAG context before LLM calls, enforce safety policies on tool execution, track costs — without replacing any module.

This is how the same framework models different agent products:

| Agent Product | KohakuTerrarium Configuration |
|--------------|-------------------------------|
| **Claude Code / Codex** | CLIInput + StdoutOutput + [bash, read, write, edit, grep, glob] + sub-agents(explore, plan, worker) |
| **Neuro-sama (VTuber)** | ASRInput + TTSOutput + TimerTrigger + [think, scratchpad] + interactive sub-agents |
| **Monitoring bot** | NoneInput + WebhookOutput + SchedulerTrigger + [bash, http] |
| **Discord chatbot** | DiscordInput + DiscordOutput + [web_search, web_fetch, think] |
| **Research assistant** | CLIInput + FileOutput + [web_search, web_fetch, read, write] + sub-agents(explore, research) |

Same framework. Different configs. Each is a standalone creature that also works unchanged inside a multi-agent terrarium.

## Why KohakuTerrarium Is Different

<table>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top" width="50%">
      <strong>Inside a creature (vertical)</strong><br>
      One controller delegates to tools and sub-agents.<br>

      Independent creatures communicate through channels.<br>
      This is the <em>multi-agent wiring</em> — a pure composition layer.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

These two levels stay separate by design. A creature never knows it's in a terrarium. A terrarium never inspects creature internals.

- **First-class agent abstraction**: a creature is a complete agent — controller, memory, tools, I/O, triggers, sub-agents — not a workflow node, not a chat participant, not a thin LLM wrapper
- **Universal**: the same five module types model coding agents, chatbots, monitoring daemons, and real-time streaming agents
- **Comprehensively customizable**: every module is swappable, plugins intercept the flows between modules, and the whole thing is config-driven
- **Reusable**: build an agent once, run it solo or in teams — same config, same behavior
- **Persistent by default**: sessions save full agent state (conversations, tool metadata, sub-agent state, triggers), not just chat history
- **Many surfaces, one abstraction**: CLI, TUI, HTTP API, web dashboard, and native desktop app all drive the same underlying agent
- **Shareable**: package and install creature / terrarium configs from Git or local sources

## Key Capabilities

Beyond the creature / terrarium philosophy, KohakuTerrarium already has a strong practical runtime surface:

- **Frontier-style built-in working set**: the default `general` creature ships with file, shell, search, JSON, HTTP, channel, trigger, and introspection tools, plus built-in sub-agents for exploration, planning, implementation, review, summarization, and research.
- **Non-blocking execution and compaction flow**: tools start immediately during LLM streaming, background jobs do not block the agent loop, and compaction / resume are built into the runtime instead of bolted on afterward.
- **Session history as operational memory**: `.kohakutr` session files persist conversations, events, jobs, tool metadata, sub-agent state, scratchpad state, channel history, and resumable triggers in a structured store rather than a flat transcript.
- **Plugin and extension system**: prompt plugins inject context before LLM calls; lifecycle plugins intercept tool execution, sub-agent dispatch, and event processing. Custom modules (tools, inputs, outputs, triggers) are loaded from agent folders or installable packages.
- **Desktop app**: `kt app` launches a native window via pywebview with text selection, copy support, and close confirmation — same web UI, no browser needed.

### Naming
- **Terrarium**: a contained world with two levels of meaning. For the creator, it is the world you build agents in. For the creatures, it is the world they live in — any agent architecture can inhabit this framework, and the terrarium layer mimics a small ecosystem where creatures interact through shared environment rather than direct control.
- **Creature**: something that *lives* in an environment, not just an API endpoint. The naming reinforces that KT thinks about agents as inhabitants of a world.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
git clone https://github.com/Kohaku-Lab/KohakuTerrarium.git
cd KohakuTerrarium
pip install -e .

# Install the default packaged creatures / terrariums
kt install https://github.com/Kohaku-Lab/kohaku-creatures.git

# Authenticate for the bundled SWE configs (uses ChatGPT subscription via Codex OAuth)
kt login codex

# Run a single creature
kt run @kohaku-creatures/creatures/swe

# Run a multi-agent terrarium (full TUI with tabs)
kt terrarium run @kohaku-creatures/terrariums/swe_team
```

The framework is not limited to Codex OAuth. It also supports OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google Gemini APIs.

## Model Management

KohakuTerrarium ships with 50+ LLM presets covering OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, Qwen, and others. Short aliases like `claude`, `gemini`, `gpt5` make switching easy.

```bash
# Authenticate with any supported provider
kt login codex          # ChatGPT subscription (OAuth)
kt login openrouter     # OpenRouter API key
kt login openai         # OpenAI API key
kt login anthropic      # Anthropic API key
kt login gemini         # Google Gemini API key

# Browse and set a default
kt model list
kt model default claude-sonnet-4.6

# Override per-run
kt run @kohaku-creatures/creatures/swe --llm gemini
```

Agent configs reference profiles by name:

```yaml
controller:
  llm: gpt-5.4          # profile name (recommended)
  temperature: 0.7       # inline overrides still work
```

Resolution order: `--llm` CLI flag, then config `llm` field, then default model, then inline fallback. API keys are stored in `~/.kohakuterrarium/api_keys.yaml`; profiles and the default model are stored in `~/.kohakuterrarium/llm_profiles.yaml`.

## Programmatic Usage

KohakuTerrarium is not only a CLI / TUI application. It is also a Python framework you can embed inside your own scripts, services, and backends.

### Use an agent inside your own script

```python
import asyncio

from kohakuterrarium.core.agent import Agent


async def main() -> None:
    agent = Agent.from_path("creatures/general")
    agent.set_output_handler(lambda text: print(text), replace_default=True)

    await agent.start()
    try:
        await agent.inject_input("Summarize what this framework is for.")
    finally:
        await agent.stop()


asyncio.run(main())
```

Use this style when you want to embed one creature inside an existing application and drive it directly from Python.

### Start and control a terrarium programmatically

```python
import asyncio

from kohakuterrarium.core.channel import ChannelMessage
from kohakuterrarium.terrarium.config import load_terrarium_config
from kohakuterrarium.terrarium.runtime import TerrariumRuntime


async def main() -> None:
    config = load_terrarium_config("terrariums/swe_team")
    runtime = TerrariumRuntime(config)

    await runtime.start()
    try:
        tasks = runtime.environment.shared_channels.get("tasks")
        if tasks is not None:
            await tasks.send(ChannelMessage(
                sender="user",
                content="Review the pagination logic for edge cases.",
            ))

        print(runtime.get_status())
        await runtime.run()
    finally:
        await runtime.stop()


asyncio.run(main())
```

Use this when you want the terrarium runtime as part of a Python workflow, automation script, or custom application loop.

### Build your own backend on top of `KohakuManager`

```python
import asyncio

from kohakuterrarium.serving.manager import KohakuManager


async def main() -> None:
    manager = KohakuManager(session_dir="./sessions")

    agent_id = await manager.agent_create(config_path="creatures/general")
    try:
        async for chunk in manager.agent_chat(agent_id, "What tools do you have?"):
            print(chunk, end="")
    finally:
        await manager.agent_stop(agent_id)


asyncio.run(main())
```

`KohakuManager` is the transport-agnostic serving layer behind the HTTP API. Use it if you want to design your own API server, worker process, or UI on top of the framework.

For more detail, see `docs/api-reference/python.md` and the examples in `examples/code/`.

## Core Concepts

### Creature

A creature is a standalone agent: its own controller, tools, sub-agents, memory, triggers, and I/O. You can run it directly with `kt run <path>`.

A creature is not a simple ReAct loop. It is a multi-agent system internally: the controller orchestrates, sub-agents execute specialized tasks in parallel, results feed back into the controller's decision-making. This is the same architecture as frontier systems like Claude Code.

### Terrarium

A terrarium connects creatures through shared channels, injects the wiring they need, and manages lifecycle and observability. It does **not** add another reasoning layer.

Think of it as a service mesh: routing, lifecycle, observability, but no business logic. Or think of it as a contained world — creatures live in it, interact through shared channels, but each creature is autonomous.

### Root Agent

A terrarium can optionally define a **root agent** that sits **outside** the terrarium and manages it through terrarium tools such as `terrarium_send`, `terrarium_observe`, `terrarium_status`, and the creature control tools.

### Channels

Channels are how creatures communicate:

- **Queue**: one consumer per message
- **Broadcast**: all subscribers receive every message

Sending is explicit via `send_message`; receiving happens through injected channel triggers.

### Modules

Everything extensible in KohakuTerrarium fits into one of five protocol-based module types:

| Module | What It Does | Example Custom Use |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Input** | Receives external events | Discord listener, webhook, voice input |
| **Output** | Delivers agent output | Discord sender, TTS, file writer |
| **Tool** | Executes actions | RAG retrieval, API calls, database queries |
| **Trigger** | Generates automatic events | Timer, channel watcher, condition monitor |
| **Sub-agent** | Delegated task execution | Any specialized reasoning task |

This is the extensibility mechanism. RAG is a custom input/trigger plus a tool. Monitoring is a trigger plus an output module. External integrations are tools plus triggers. The framework doesn't need to ship every feature because the module system makes everything composable.

### Sessions and Isolation

- **Environment**: shared terrarium state, especially shared channels
- **Session**: private creature state, including scratchpad and sub-agent state

That keeps team communication shared while creature internals stay private.

## Session Persistence

Every session is automatically saved to `~/.kohakuterrarium/sessions/` unless disabled.

Resume anytime:

```bash
kt resume                    # list recent, pick interactively
kt resume --last             # most recent session
kt resume swe_team           # prefix match
```

Session files use the `.kohakutr` format and contain far more than a plain transcript — they capture operational state:

- conversation history
- full tool call metadata
- append-only event log
- scratchpad state
- token usage
- sub-agent conversations
- channel messages
- job records
- resumable triggers
- config and topology metadata

Sessions are also searchable. The `search_memory` tool gives agents keyword and semantic search over their own history, and the CLI exposes the same capability:

```bash
kt search my_session "how did we fix the auth bug"    # hybrid (FTS + vector)
kt search my_session "database error" --mode fts      # keyword only
kt embedding my_session                               # build vector index
```

## Runtime Surfaces

### TUI (Terminal UI)

Full-screen Textual app with:

- **Terrarium tabs**: root agent, each creature, each channel
- **Accordion tools**: collapsible blocks showing tool name, args, and output
- **Right panel**: running tasks, scratchpad viewer, session info, terrarium overview
- **Escape to interrupt**: cancels current LLM generation while keeping the agent alive
- **Sub-agent nesting**: tool lines appear inside sub-agent accordion blocks
- **Shared model with web UI**: the TUI and web dashboard present the same runtime concepts

### Web Dashboard

Vue 3 frontend with real-time streaming:

```bash
pip install -e ".[web]"
python -m kohakuterrarium.api.main        # API on :8001
npm run dev --prefix src/kohakuterrarium-frontend     # Frontend on :5173
```

Features:

- topology graph
- multi-tab chat
- tool accordion
- running tasks panel
- session resume
- channel message feed
- token tracking
- dark / light mode

### Interrupt System

Interruption exists across all interfaces:

- **TUI**: `Escape`
- **Web**: stop button or `Escape`
- **API**: `POST /api/agents/{id}/interrupt` or `POST /api/terrariums/{id}/creatures/{name}/interrupt`
- **Tools**: `stop_task` cancels a background tool or sub-agent by job ID
- **Root agent**: `creature_interrupt` interrupts a creature without stopping it

## Package System

Share and install creature / terrarium configs:

```bash
# Install from git
kt install https://github.com/someone/cool-creatures.git

# Install local (editable, for development)
kt install ./my-creatures -e

# List installed packages
kt list

# Run from a package
kt run @cool-creatures/creatures/my-agent
kt terrarium run @cool-creatures/terrariums/my-team

# Edit a config
kt edit @kohaku-creatures/creatures/general
```

Packages use `@package-name/path` references for cross-package inheritance:

```yaml
# config.yaml
base_config: "@kohaku-creatures/creatures/swe"
```

A package typically looks like this:

```text
my-package/
  kohaku.yaml
  creatures/
    my-agent/
      config.yaml
      prompts/
  terrariums/
    my-team/
      terrarium.yaml
```
