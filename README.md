KohakuTerrarium is built around one design choice: **single-agent orchestration and multi-agent coordination are different problems, and they should stay separate**.

- A **creature** is a complete agent with its own LLM controller, tools, sub-agents, memory, triggers, input, and output.
- A **terrarium** is a **pure wiring layer** that connects creatures through channels, manages lifecycle, and exposes observability. It is not another hidden planner or meta-agent.
- The same creature config can run **standalone** or inside a terrarium **unchanged**.

That separation is the project’s core idea, and it drives the runtime, the TUI, the web dashboard, the API, and the session system.

## Why KohakuTerrarium Is Different

  <tr>
    <td valign="top" width="50%">
      <strong>Inside a creature</strong><br>
      Vertical coordination<br>
      One controller delegates to tools and sub-agents.

      <strong>Between creatures</strong><br>
      Horizontal coordination<br>
      Independent creatures communicate explicitly through channels.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

This gives you a cleaner split than frameworks that blur everything into one orchestration layer:

- **Reusable creatures**: build once, run solo or in teams
- **Opaque team members**: terrariums do not inspect creature internals
- **Explicit communication**: creatures collaborate via named channels, not hidden routing magic
- **Persistent by default**: sessions save rich runtime state, not just chat history
- **One runtime, many surfaces**: CLI, TUI, HTTP API, and web UI sit on the same underlying system
- **Shareable configs**: package and install creature / terrarium configs from Git or local sources

## Key Capabilities

Beyond the creature / terrarium philosophy, KohakuTerrarium already has a strong practical runtime surface:

- **Frontier-style built-in working set**: the default `general` creature ships with file, shell, search, JSON, HTTP, channel, trigger, and introspection tools, plus built-in sub-agents for exploration, planning, implementation, review, summarization, and research.
- **Non-blocking execution and compaction flow**: tools start immediately during LLM streaming, background jobs do not block the agent loop, and compaction / resume are built into the runtime instead of bolted on afterward.
- **Session history as operational memory**: `.kohakutr` session files persist conversations, events, jobs, tool metadata, sub-agent state, scratchpad state, channel history, and resumable triggers in a structured store rather than a flat transcript.

```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
git clone https://github.com/Kohaku-Lab/KohakuTerrarium.git
cd KohakuTerrarium
pip install -e .

# Install the default packaged creatures / terrariums
kt install https://github.com/Kohaku-Lab/kohaku-creatures.git

# Authenticate for the bundled SWE configs (uses ChatGPT subscription via Codex OAuth)
kt login codex

# Run a single creature
kt run @kohaku-creatures/creatures/swe

# Run a multi-agent terrarium (full TUI with tabs)
kt terrarium run @kohaku-creatures/terrariums/swe_team
```

The framework is not limited to Codex OAuth. It also supports OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google Gemini APIs.

## Model Management

KohakuTerrarium ships with 50+ LLM presets covering OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, Qwen, and others. Short aliases like `claude`, `gemini`, `gpt5` make switching easy.

```bash
# Authenticate with any supported provider
kt login codex          # ChatGPT subscription (OAuth)
kt login openrouter     # OpenRouter API key
kt login openai         # OpenAI API key
kt login anthropic      # Anthropic API key
kt login gemini         # Google Gemini API key

# Browse and set a default
kt model list
kt model default claude-sonnet-4.6

# Override per-run
kt run @kohaku-creatures/creatures/swe --llm gemini
```

Agent configs reference profiles by name:

```yaml
controller:
  llm: gpt-5.4          # profile name (recommended)
  temperature: 0.7       # inline overrides still work
```

Resolution order: `--llm` CLI flag, then config `llm` field, then default model, then inline fallback. API keys are stored in `~/.kohakuterrarium/api_keys.yaml`; profiles and the default model are stored in `~/.kohakuterrarium/llm_profiles.yaml`.

## Programmatic Usage

KohakuTerrarium is not only a CLI / TUI application. It is also a Python framework you can embed inside your own scripts, services, and backends.

### Use an agent inside your own script

```python
import asyncio

from kohakuterrarium.core.agent import Agent


async def main() -> None:
    agent = Agent.from_path("creatures/general")
    agent.set_output_handler(lambda text: print(text), replace_default=True)

    await agent.start()
    try:
        await agent.inject_input("Summarize what this framework is for.")
    finally:
        await agent.stop()


asyncio.run(main())
```

Use this style when you want to embed one creature inside an existing application and drive it directly from Python.

### Start and control a terrarium programmatically

```python
import asyncio

from kohakuterrarium.core.channel import ChannelMessage
from kohakuterrarium.terrarium.config import load_terrarium_config
from kohakuterrarium.terrarium.runtime import TerrariumRuntime


async def main() -> None:
    config = load_terrarium_config("terrariums/swe_team")
    runtime = TerrariumRuntime(config)

    await runtime.start()
    try:
        tasks = runtime.environment.shared_channels.get("tasks")
        if tasks is not None:
            await tasks.send(ChannelMessage(
                sender="user",
                content="Review the pagination logic for edge cases.",
            ))

        print(runtime.get_status())
        await runtime.run()
    finally:
        await runtime.stop()


asyncio.run(main())
```

Use this when you want the terrarium runtime as part of a Python workflow, automation script, or custom application loop.

### Build your own backend on top of `KohakuManager`

```python
import asyncio

from kohakuterrarium.serving.manager import KohakuManager


async def main() -> None:
    manager = KohakuManager(session_dir="./sessions")

    agent_id = await manager.agent_create(config_path="creatures/general")
    try:
        async for chunk in manager.agent_chat(agent_id, "What tools do you have?"):
            print(chunk, end="")
    finally:
        await manager.agent_stop(agent_id)


asyncio.run(main())
```

`KohakuManager` is the transport-agnostic serving layer behind the HTTP API. Use it if you want to design your own API server, worker process, or UI on top of the framework.

For more detail, see `docs/api-reference/python.md` and the examples in `examples/code/`.

## Core Concepts

### Creature

A creature is a standalone agent: its own controller, tools, sub-agents, memory, triggers, and I/O. You can run it directly with `kt run <path>`.

### Terrarium

A terrarium connects creatures through shared channels, injects the wiring they need, and manages lifecycle and observability. It does **not** add another reasoning layer.

### Root Agent

A terrarium can optionally define a **root agent** that sits **outside** the terrarium and manages it through terrarium tools such as `terrarium_send`, `terrarium_observe`, `terrarium_status`, and the creature control tools.

### Channels

Channels are how creatures communicate:

- **Queue**: one consumer per message
- **Broadcast**: all subscribers receive every message

Sending is explicit via `send_message`; receiving happens through injected channel triggers.

### Sessions and Isolation

- **Environment**: shared terrarium state, especially shared channels
- **Session**: private creature state, including scratchpad and sub-agent state

That keeps team communication shared while creature internals stay private.

## Session Persistence

Every session is automatically saved to `~/.kohakuterrarium/sessions/` unless disabled.

Resume anytime:

```bash
kt resume                    # list recent, pick interactively
kt resume --last             # most recent session
kt resume swe_team           # prefix match
```

Session files use the `.kohakutr` format and contain far more than a plain chat transcript:

- conversation history
- full tool call metadata
- append-only event log
- scratchpad state
- token usage
- sub-agent conversations
- channel messages
- job records
- resumable triggers
- config and topology metadata

Sessions are also searchable. The `search_memory` tool gives agents keyword and semantic search over their own history, and the CLI exposes the same capability:

```bash
kt search my_session "how did we fix the auth bug"    # hybrid (FTS + vector)
kt search my_session "database error" --mode fts      # keyword only
kt embedding my_session                               # build vector index
```

## Runtime Surfaces

### TUI (Terminal UI)

Full-screen Textual app with:

- **Terrarium tabs**: root agent, each creature, each channel
- **Accordion tools**: collapsible blocks showing tool name, args, and output
- **Right panel**: running tasks, scratchpad viewer, session info, terrarium overview
- **Escape to interrupt**: cancels current LLM generation while keeping the agent alive
- **Sub-agent nesting**: tool lines appear inside sub-agent accordion blocks
- **Shared model with web UI**: the TUI and web dashboard present the same runtime concepts

### Web Dashboard

Vue 3 frontend with real-time streaming:

```bash
pip install -e ".[web]"
python -m kohakuterrarium.api.main        # API on :8001
npm run dev --prefix src/kohakuterrarium-frontend     # Frontend on :5173
```

Features:

- topology graph
- multi-tab chat
- tool accordion
- running tasks panel
- session resume
- channel message feed
- token tracking
- dark / light mode

### Interrupt System

Interruption exists across all interfaces:

- **TUI**: `Escape`
- **Web**: stop button or `Escape`
- **API**: `POST /api/agents/{id}/interrupt` or `POST /api/terrariums/{id}/creatures/{name}/interrupt`
- **Tools**: `stop_task` cancels a background tool or sub-agent by job ID
- **Root agent**: `creature_interrupt` interrupts a creature without stopping it

## Package System

Share and install creature / terrarium configs:

```bash
# Install from git
kt install https://github.com/someone/cool-creatures.git

# Install local (editable, for development)
kt install ./my-creatures -e

# List installed packages
kt list

# Run from a package
kt run @cool-creatures/creatures/my-agent
kt terrarium run @cool-creatures/terrariums/my-team

# Edit a config
kt edit @kohaku-creatures/creatures/general
```

Packages use `@package-name/path` references for cross-package inheritance:

```yaml
# config.yaml
base_config: "@kohaku-creatures/creatures/swe"
```

A package typically looks like this:

```text
my-package/
  kohaku.yaml
  creatures/
    my-agent/
      config.yaml
      prompts/
  terrariums/
    my-team/
      terrarium.yaml
```

## Default Creatures and Terrariums
